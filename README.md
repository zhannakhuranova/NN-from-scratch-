# neural-network-from-scratch-


******************************************************************************

Simple perceptron from Scratch in C++ language with tanh activation function and creating .dat file in the end( you can plot graph via gnuplot)

-2 options for inserting of the input data; 

a.txt file : 

1 0 0     //1 line is for mode of inserting data 2 - from a file 
1 0 0 1  //4 on 3 matrix is a predicted data classes , if input data is 1 0 0 asoosciate with 1, if other - with 0   ( 1 and 
0 1 0 0   //0 in a last column is a dessire meanin of activating function )
0 0 1 0



In the end, a meaning of the weight-loss function written in a file ".dat", that you could plot via Gnuplot
