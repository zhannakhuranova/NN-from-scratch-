# neural-network-from-scratch-

A perceptron (single neuron) neural network model writing from Scratch in C++.

The sigmoid activation function has been chosen because of solving the classification problem. The weights generated randomly in a [-4;4] range.
Input data : could be 0 or 1.


Some assestment added.


******************************************************************************

In the a.txt:

1st line: for the second mode of inserting data {1 0 0};

Matrix 3×4: first 3 columns - input data, the last column - outputing labeled class 0 or 1

"1 0 0 1" corresponding to the "1" class
"0 1 0 0" to 0 class
"0 0 1 0" to the 0

In the end created "hello.csv" with loss function. Example of the lossfunction plot attached.
