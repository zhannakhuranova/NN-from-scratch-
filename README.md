# neural-network-from-scratch-



Here writting a perceptron (single neuron ) neural neywork model writting from Scratch in C++ language.
Sigmoid activation function have chosen for solving classification problem.
In the end, create a file called "hello.dat" file, and .dat format coud plot via Gnuplot.



******************************************************************************


Features of the program:

-2 modes of inserting input data ( from terminal or from file)

-The weight generic randomply in a (-4;4) range;





******************************************************************************



In 'a.txt" file : 



1st line: for second mode of inserting data;


Matrix 3Ã—4: describe classify the data; 


Input data :
Input data could be anything, but here have chosen this kind of input data :

"1 0 0" corresponding to "1" class

"0 1 0" to 0 classes 

"0 0 1" to the 0 also.

Weight generic randon in a range (-4, 4) because of activation function.
