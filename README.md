# neural-network-from-scratch-


Simple 1-layer neural network from Scratch in c++ language;
Create .dat file for creating a plots (gnuplot)

-2 options for insert the input data;
-Activation function - sigmoid 
-Predicted data is a 3 type of classes, that stored in a file.

In the end, a meaning of weight-loss function  writting in a file ".dat", that you could plot via gnuplot
