# neural-network-from-scratch-


Simple 1-layer neural network from Scratch in C++ language; 


Create .dat file for creating a plot ( via gnuplot)

-2 options for inserting of the input data; 
-Activation function - sigmoid function;



a.txt file : 

1 0 0  //1 line is for mode of inserting data 2 - from a file 
1 0 0 1 
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0


//first 3 column - type of inserting data  
//the last - dessiring meaning of actication function



In the end, a meaning of the weight-loss function written in a file ".dat", that you could plot via Gnuplot
