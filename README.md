# neural-network-with-1neuron-from-scratch

A perceptron (single neuron) neural network model implemented in C++ for the classification with sigmoid activation function within and weights [4:4]

In the a.txt:
  1st line: the second mode of the inserting data i.g. {1 0 0} 
  Matrix 3×4 below: first three columns are input data    
  "1 0 0 1" corresponding to the label "1" 
  "0 1 0 0" to 0 
  "0 0 1 0" to the 0

In the end created "hello.csv" with weights gradient value and loss function. 
Loss function plots with plot.py.
