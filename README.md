In the a.txt:

1st line: the second mode of inserting data: {1 0 0});
Matrix 3×4: first 3 columns - input data, the last column - outputing labeled class 0 or 1
"1 0 0 1" corresponding to the "1" 
"0 1 0 0" to 0 
"0 0 1 0" to the 0

In the end created "hello.csv" with loss function. 
Lossfunction plot attached.
