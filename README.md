******************************************************************************

Simple perceptron NN model from Scratch in C++ language

with sigmoid activation function for solving classification problem 

with creation "hello.dat" file in the end, which you couild plot via Gnuplot.



-2 modes for inserting input data;
-The weight generic in a (-4;4) diapason




In a.txt file : 
1st line for second mode of inserting data;
Matrix 3×4 for classify a data; 
Input data 1 0 0 corresponding to 1;


0 1 0 to ZERO and 0 0 1 to the ZER0 also.
