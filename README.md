# neural-network-from-scratch-


******************************************************************************

Simple perceptron NN model from Scratch in C++ language with sigmoid activation function for soving classification problem. Creating .dat file in the end( you can plot graph via gnuplot)
-2 options for inserting input data;



In a.txt file : 

1 0 0     //1 line is for mode second of inserting data ( from a file )
1 0 0 1   //if input data is 1 0 0 associate with "1" ; 
0 1 0 0   //if 0 1 1 - "0"
0 0 1 0   



In the end, a meaning of the weights and loss function written in a file ".dat",
that you could plot via Gnuplot.
